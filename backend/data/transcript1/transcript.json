            "speaker": "Dr. Smith",

            "speaker": "Dr. Smith",
            "text": "It might be. Screen time can sometimes contribute to headaches. How about your fatigue? Is it constant, or does it come and go?"

        {
            "speaker": "Alex Johnson",
            "text": "It's more like a constant feeling of being drained. I wake up tired even after a full night's sleep."
